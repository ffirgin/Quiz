# Quiz

## Description

This project is intended to be used as a Quiz application. It will test your knowledge by asking a few questions regarding basic programming. I built this project to build on the foundations of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

1. On the repository, click Code, and copy the HTTPS link.
2. Open your Git Bash terminal.
3. Navigate to where you store your repositories locally on your system
   ie. ~/Documents/GitHub/, etc
4. Type `git clone ` and paste the HTTPS link from the repository page at the end of the line.
5. Hit Enter and allow the repository to be downloaded.
6. Success! You've downloaded the repository! ♪⁽⁽٩( ᐖ )۶⁾⁾ ₍₍٩( ᐛ )۶₎₎♪

## Usage

Once loaded into your Live Server or visited through the GitHub Pages, you'll be able to click the start button to take the quiz.
